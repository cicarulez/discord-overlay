Reporting a vulnerability
-------------------------
Please report security issues privately to <security-contact@example.com> with details and (if possible) a proof of concept. We aim to acknowledge within 5 business days and will work with you on a coordinated disclosure timeline.

Do not create public issues for security vulnerabilities until a fix is released.
